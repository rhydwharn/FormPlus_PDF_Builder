# FormPlus_PDF_Builder
This is an interview question solution

The Fillable function on the PDF is totally not working, the implementation done is not how PDF fillable file works. 

I attached a document that is an example of a fillable PDF file. The file name is Fillable_PDF_Sample.pdf.

The PDF file can be filled on any PDF viewer. Review this for onward development of the application.

Regards
